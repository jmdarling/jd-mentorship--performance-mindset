# Performance Mindset Demo

This repository contains the Demo portion of my Performance Mindset mentorship session. Its purpose is to hi-light the difference between a performant algorithm, and an inperformant algorithm.

The performant algorithm is represented by JavaScript's `array.prototype.sort` method. This can be viewed by running:

```sh
node jssort.js
```

The inperformant algorithm is represented by a custom Bozosort. This can be viewed by running:

```sh
node bozosort.js
```
